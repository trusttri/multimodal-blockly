## Advice on using gesture
- Adjust the distance betwen the leap motion sensor and the hand.
- In order to pick a block from the "viewer(the area where you put the blocks)", your hand has to be close enough to the sensor. Otherwise the block will not be picked up. 
- Watching the tutorial videos first is recommended.
